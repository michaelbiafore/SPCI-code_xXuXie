# Update: Converting Someone Else's Repo (No Further Development)

## User Query

"In this particular case I'm turning someone else's repo into a package I can use. So I will not be doing any further development on it. Does that change your suggested course of action?"

## Response

Yes, that **absolutely changes** the recommended approach! Since you're not doing further development and just want to use someone else's code as a package, here's what I recommend:

## Updated Recommendation: Option 2 - Build a Proper Wheel

Since you're just converting someone else's code into a usable package without further development:

```powershell
# Use any temporary environment or your base environment
conda activate base  # or any existing environment

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the package into a wheel
pip install build
python -m build

# The wheel will be in dist/ folder
# Install it in any target environment with:
pip install dist/spci-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Why This Approach for Non-Development Use

1. **No Development Environment Needed**: No need for a dedicated spci-dev environment
2. **Clean Distribution**: Creates a proper wheel file that can be easily shared
3. **Version Locked**: The wheel contains a specific version, no accidental changes
4. **Professional**: Standard way to distribute Python packages
5. **Portable**: The wheel file can be copied and installed anywhere

## Updated Next Steps

**For converting existing code to a package (no further development):**

1. Install build tools: `pip install build`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
3. Build the package: `python -m build`
4. Install the wheel in target projects: `pip install dist/spci-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
5. Import in your projects: `import spci`

## Alternative Quick Method

If you just want to test it works, you can also do:
```powershell
pip install .
```
This installs it directly without creating a wheel file.

## Summary

Since you're just converting someone else's repo into a package for your own use (not developing it further), **Option 2 (build a proper wheel)** is much simpler and more appropriate for your use case:

- **Build once**: Create a wheel file from the current code
- **Install anywhere**: Use that wheel in any of your project environments
- **No ongoing maintenance**: The package is "frozen" at this version
- **Clean and professional**: Standard Python packaging approach
